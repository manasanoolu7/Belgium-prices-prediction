### GUDELINES
1. please use typing and commenting (Not only Maxime likes it !!) 
1. Function with default (reccomended values) already assigned to main attributes.
1. In the end we should comply **at least** with required features and evalution critera (see Trello)
1. Feel free to provide additional details useful for the team in this file **without removing existing lines**. 

Thanks for your hard work so far !! :) 

e.g.
```Python
from typing import List
def replace_null( df: pd.DataFrame,
                   x: List[str] = ["facades_number", "a column"]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    List: only columns to be considered for repalcement
    return
    """
    ...
    return df_no_null
```
